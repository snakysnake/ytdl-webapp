# Noob Help
This project, as u know.. kinda s*cks and you have to downgrade to node v14.7.0 if you want it working.
This can be a good practice for beginners and i would recommend you using nvm to switch node versions. 
look up nvm github and just copy paste their commands and its gonna work smooth on your pc!
