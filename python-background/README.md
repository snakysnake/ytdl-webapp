# Beginner Help

Hi I am sort of a beginner with Python aswell so... Here is how I got it running:
Create virtual environment (using venv). Then activate the environment and try running download_worker.py and installing every package that comes up when there is an error.
Without venv I had some issues so if you are running into weird errors too, try that.
